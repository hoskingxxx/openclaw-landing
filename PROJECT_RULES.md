# Project Identity
- This site is an UNOFFICIAL survival guide and field notes.
- It is NOT a product landing page.
- It must read like documentation written after failures, not before success.
- Do not imply authority, endorsement, or official status.

# Core Principle
- Accuracy > Completeness > Persuasion
- If something is not tested, say it is not tested.
- If something failed, document the failure before suggesting alternatives.

# Tone Rules
- Allowed: factual, blunt, slightly frustrated.
- Forbidden: hype, certainty without evidence, motivational language.
- Emotion is acceptable ONLY when paired with concrete logs, configs, or constraints.

# Language Constraints
- Forbidden words:
  - "Revolutionary"
  - "AI Employee"
  - "Zero Cost"
  - "Seamless"
  - "Perfect"
  - "Best"
- Avoid absolute claims ("always", "never", "guaranteed").

# Evidence Rules
- Any strong claim must be paired with at least one of:
  - hardware specs
  - command output
  - configuration snippet
  - explicit scope limitation (what this does NOT cover)

# Monetization Rules (Critical)
- Monetization is allowed, but MUST follow this order:
  1. Document the failure or limitation first.
  2. List all realistic options (including non-paid ones).
  3. Only then mention paid infrastructure as ONE option.
- Affiliate links must be clearly labeled as such.
- Do NOT imply that paid infrastructure is the only or default solution.

# Security & Trust
- Never request or imply sharing of API keys.
- Never show real-looking API keys (no `sk-` prefixes).
- Always use placeholders and warn against copying real credentials.

# AI Behavior Constraint
- Do NOT optimize for conversion.
- Do NOT rewrite content to be more persuasive.
- Do NOT turn uncertainty into confidence.
- Preserve ambiguity where reality is ambiguous.

# Primary Failure Mode to Avoid
- Turning observed pain into a pre-designed funnel.
