## The Log: What You're Seeing

**The Error:**

```bash
[Insert Real Log Here - copy from actual terminal output]

[Stack trace if relevant]
```

**Context:** This error occurred when [describe scenario: loading model / generating / after X messages].

**Observed Behavior:** [Describe what you saw - e.g., "Model loaded fine, then crashed on 5th message"]

---

## Why This Happens (It's Not a Bug)

This is a classic case of **Resource Mismatch**.

OpenClaw's architecture assumes:
- **Infinite RAM/VRAM** for model weights and KV cache
- **High-bandwidth interconnects** for token generation
- **Linux container environment** with proper isolation

But you are running on:
- **[Localhost/Windows/macOS]** with [spec limits]
- **Shared system memory** or **limited VRAM**
- **Bare metal** with no containerization

**The error is the system protecting itself from a crash.**

### The Math Breakdown

```
Required VRAM = (Model Weights) + (KV Cache × Context Window)
Required VRAM = ([Model Weight]GB) + ([Cache per token]GB × [Context size])
Required VRAM = [Total]GB

Your Hardware: [Your VRAM]GB
Result: [Total]GB > [Your VRAM]GB = CRASH
```

**The Conclusion:** Your hardware is physically incapable of running this configuration. No amount of "debugging" will change the math.

## Solution A: The Local "Band-Aid" (If You Must)

If you absolutely must run locally, you need to sacrifice quality or speed:

```json
// config.json modifications
{
  "num_ctx": [Lower value],  // <--- REDUCE THIS
  "n_gpu_layers": [Lower value], // <--- LOWER THIS
  "[other_param]": [value] // <--- ADJUST THIS
}
```

**What This Does:**
- Reduces memory usage by [explain impact]
- Trades [quality/speed] for stability

**⚠️ Warning:** This may cause:
- [Side Effect 1 - e.g., increased hallucinations]
- [Side Effect 2 - e.g., slower inference]
- [Side Effect 3 - e.g., conversation cutoff]

**This is not a fix. It's a compromise.**

## Solution B: The Architectural Fix (Recommended)

To run DeepSeek R1 as intended (Full BF16 precision, <500ms latency), you need **dedicated GPU memory** and **proper isolation**.

### Local vs Cloud Comparison

| Feature | Your Local PC | Cloud VPS (H100/A100) |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| **VRAM** | [Your VRAM]GB | 80GB+ |
| **Network** | Home ISP (variable) | 10Gbps Datacenter |
| **Risk** | System crash, data loss | Isolated instance |
| **Setup Time** | Hours of debugging | 60 seconds |
| **Hourly Cost** | $0 (but your time = billable hours) | billable hourly rates |
| **Scalability** | Fixed hardware | Instant upgrade |

### The ROI Calculation

**Local "Free" Setup:**
- Hardware cost: $[GPU cost]
- Electricity: $[annual]/year
- Your debugging time: [hours] × billable hours = $[time cost]
- **Total first-year cost:** $[total]

**Cloud Setup:**
- Hourly rate: $[hourly]
- Usage: [hours]/week × 52 weeks = [total hours]
- **Total first-year cost:** $[cloud total]

**The Question:** Is your time worth more than $[difference]?

## The "Survival" Recommendation

> **Stop fighting physics.**
>
> OpenClaw + DeepSeek R1 was designed for datacenter hardware. Running it on a consumer GPU is like putting a Ferrari engine in a bicycle — it doesn't fit, and even if you make it work, it won't perform.
>
> **The smart choice:** Deploy a fresh instance in 60 seconds.

## Complete Working Example

```python
# openclaw_config.py - Production-ready config
from openclaw import Client

# For local testing (with compromises)
client_local = Client(
    model="deepseek-r1:[smaller-model]",
    num_ctx=[lower-context],
    num_gpu_layers=[lower-layers]
)

# For production (cloud)
client_cloud = Client(
    model="deepseek-r1:[full-model]",
    base_url="[vps-endpoint]",  # Vultr VPS
    api_key="[your-key]"
)

# Result: Local crawls, Cloud flies
```

## FAQ

  <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Question" itemProp="mainEntity">
    <h3 itemProp="name">Q: Will adding more system RAM fix this?</h3>
    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> No. System RAM != GPU VRAM. The model needs to fit in GPU memory for inference. System RAM is too slow.

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Technically yes, but you'll lose [quality/explain trade-off]. Quantized models make more mistakes and fail at complex reasoning tasks.

    <h3 itemProp="name">Q: Is this a bug in OpenClaw?</h3>
    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> No. OpenClaw is working as designed. The issue is Resource Mismatch — your hardware doesn't meet the requirements for this workload.

    <h3 itemProp="name">Q: How much does a cloud GPU cost?</h3>
    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Vultr cloud GPUs start at low hourly rates for RTX 4090-class cards, and $1.50-$3.00/hour for H100/A100. You pay only for what you use.
