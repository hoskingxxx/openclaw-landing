> **TL;DR: The 30-Second Triage**
>
> Before you spend hours installing drivers, check your hardware against this matrix.
>
> **Less than 12GB VRAM:** You will likely hit OOM or run at single-digit tokens/sec. Solution: Cloud GPU
>
> **12GB to 24GB VRAM:** Usable for quantized 7B-14B models. Full-size reasoning models (30B+) will require heavy quantization.
>
> **24GB or more VRAM:** You are in the green zone for local development.

## 📉 The Reality of Local LLMs

Running OpenClaw locally isn't just about CPU speed. The bottleneck is almost always **Memory Bandwidth** and **VRAM Capacity**.

### 1. The VRAM Bottleneck

Modern reasoning models (like the DeepSeek R1 family or Llama-3 variants) are memory-hungry.

| Precision | VRAM per 1B Parameters |
|----------|----------------------|
| FP16 (Full) | ~2 GB |
| 4-bit Quantized | ~0.7 GB |

**Reality:** A consumer card with 8GB VRAM simply cannot load a 30B+ parameter model, no matter how fast your CPU is.

### 2. The Speed Trade-off

Even if you fit the model into system RAM (CPU offloading), inference speed drops drastically.

| Offloading Method | Speed | Usability |
|------------------|-------|-----------|
| **GPU Offloading** | Real-time interaction | Interactive, usable |
| **CPU/System RAM** | 0.5-5 t/s | Painfully slow, often unusable |

## 🛠️ Hardware Tiers

### Tier C: Consumer Laptops (Integrated Graphics)

**Typical Specs:** 4-8GB unified memory, shared with CPU

**Experience:**
- High latency, low throughput
- Suitable for testing API connectivity or very small models (TinyLlama, <1B params)
- Not recommended for daily use with reasoning models

**Verdict:** API or cloud only

---

### Tier B: Gaming Desktops (12GB to 16GB VRAM)

**Typical Specs:** RTX 3060/3070/4060/4070, 8GB to 12GB VRAM

**Experience:**
- Capable of running quantized 7B/8B models comfortably
- Larger reasoning models (30B+) will OOM or require extreme quantization
- May need to reduce context window (num_ctx < 4096)

**Limitations:**
- Multi-turn conversations may slow as context fills
- Model switching requires VRAM management

**Verdict:** Good for learning, limiting for production workflows

---

### Tier A: Workstation / Cloud (24GB or more VRAM)

**Typical Specs:** RTX 3090/4090/5090, Apple Silicon (32GB+ Unified), or Cloud H100/A100

**Experience:**
- Full access to larger models (30B-70B ranges) with usable speeds
- Can run multiple models simultaneously
- Sufficient VRAM for full context windows (8k+ tokens)

**Verdict:** Required for serious local development

## 💡 Decision: Upgrade or Rent?

If your local hardware falls into Tier C or Tier B, you have a decision to make.

### Option 1: The Cloud Route (Immediate)

If you need to run large models now without buying new hardware.

**Pros:**
- Instant access to H100/A100 class GPUs
- Pay only for uptime
- No hardware management

**Cons:**
- Not offline
- Recurring cost

### Option 2: The Local Route (Long-term)

If you plan to run models 24/7 and value privacy above all.

**Pros:**
- Total data sovereignty
- One-time cost

**Cons:**
- High upfront investment (GPU, Power Supply, Cooling)
- Electricity costs

**Hardware Recommendations:**
- **NVIDIA RTX 4090** (24GB VRAM) - Best consumer option
- **NVIDIA RTX 3090** (24GB VRAM) - Good value on used market
- **Apple Mac Studio** (64GB+ Unified Memory) - Best Mac option

## 🙋 FAQ

<div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/FAQPage">
  <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Question" itemprop="mainEntity">
    <h3 itemprop="name">Why is my inference so slow (Painfully slow (seconds per word))?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemprop="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemprop="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> You are likely offloading layers to your CPU/System RAM because your GPU VRAM is full. Check your <code>num_gpu</code> or <code>n_gpu_layers</code> settings. Reduce model size, increase VRAM, or switch to GPU offloading.
      </p>

  <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Question" itemprop="mainEntity">
    <h3 itemprop="name">Can I run DeepSeek R1 on my Mac?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemprop="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemprop="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, if you have an M-series chip with sufficient Unified Memory (32GB+ recommended for decent quantization). Apple Silicon uses unified memory, so all available RAM can be used for model inference. However, memory bandwidth is still a bottleneck compared to discrete GPUs.

  <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Question" itemprop="mainEntity">
    <h3 itemprop="name">Does OpenClaw support multi-GPU?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemprop="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemprop="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> OpenClaw relies on the underlying inference engine (e.g., Ollama/Llama.cpp). Multi-GPU support depends on their specific configuration. Check the inference engine documentation for multi-GPU setup instructions.

  <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Question" itemprop="mainEntity">
    <h3 itemprop="name">What if I have 8GB VRAM but want to run 30B models?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemprop="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemprop="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> You have two options: 1) Use extreme quantization (2-bit or less) which degrades model quality significantly, or 2) Offload to CPU/system RAM which will be painfully slow (0.5-2 t/s). For 30B+ models, the practical solution is cloud GPU with 24GB+ VRAM.

  <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Question" itemprop="mainEntity">
    <h3 itemprop="name">Is unified memory (Mac) better than discrete VRAM?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemprop="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemprop="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Unified memory (Apple Silicon) offers flexibility but has lower bandwidth than discrete GPU VRAM (100-400 GB/s vs 500-1000 GB/s). For large models, discrete GPUs with high-bandwidth memory (HBM) will significantly outperform unified memory systems.
      </p>

  <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Question" itemprop="mainEntity">
    <h3 itemprop="name">How much VRAM do I need for 70B models?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemprop="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemprop="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> At 4-bit quantization, ~49GB VRAM. At 8-bit, ~98GB VRAM. Current consumer cards top out at 24GB (RTX 3090/4090), so 70B models require cloud GPUs (H100/A100 with 80GB+ VRAM) or multi-GPU setups.
