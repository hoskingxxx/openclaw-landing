> **⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT**
>
> If you're running OpenClaw locally on your main machine, **stop now**. This article explains a critical vulnerability (CVE-2026-25253) that allows remote code execution on your system.

---

## The Vulnerability: CVE-2026-25253

OpenClaw versions prior to `v0.4.2` contain a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in how they handle incoming AI model responses.

**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)
**Affected Versions:** v0.1.0 - v0.4.1
**Patched Version:** v0.4.2+

### How It Works

The vulnerability exists in OpenClaw's response parsing logic. When processing specially crafted AI responses, an attacker can:

1. Execute arbitrary commands on your system
2. Access your local files
3. Exfiltrate data from your machine

### Why This Matters for Local LLMs

When you run OpenClaw with DeepSeek R1 or other models, you're:
- Downloading model responses from the internet
- Processing potentially untrusted content
- Exposing your local environment to remote input

**If an AI model is compromised or sends malicious responses, your system is vulnerable.**

---

## The Fix

### Option 1: Update OpenClaw (Immediate)

```bash
# Check your version
ollama list | grep openclaw

# Update to the latest patched version
ollama pull openclaw:latest
```

**Minimum safe version:** `v0.4.2`

### Option 2: Run in Docker (Recommended)

Don't run OpenClaw directly on your host machine. Use Docker isolation:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name openclaw-isolated \
  --network isolated \
  -v ~/openclaw-data:/data \
  -p 11434:11434 \
  ollama/ollama:latest
```

This creates an isolated environment where:
- The RCE vulnerability is contained within the container
- Your host system remains safe
- You can kill the container if something goes wrong

### Option 3: Use a VPS (Safest)

The **safest option** is to not run OpenClaw on your local PC at all. Use a Virtual Private Server (VPS) instead.

**Why a VPS?**
- Complete isolation from your main machine
- Can be destroyed and recreated in minutes
- You control the network exposure
- No risk to your personal files

**Recommended VPS for OpenClaw:**

| Provider | Specs | Monthly Cost | Best For |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **DigitalOcean** | 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU | $24/mo | Beginners |
| **Linode** | 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU | $20/mo | Linux users |
| **Hetzner** | 4GB RAM, 2 vCPU | €10/mo | Budget option |

> **Note:** The above VPS providers have been tested with OpenClaw and DeepSeek R1. They offer the minimum RAM required (4GB) for smaller models.

## How to Verify You're Safe

### Check Your OpenClaw Version

```bash
ollama show openclaw | grep "version"
```

If it shows anything below `v0.4.2`, you're vulnerable.

### Test for the Vulnerability

OpenClaw provides a verification script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/openclaw/main/scripts/check-vulnerability.sh | bash
```

If it returns `VULNERABLE`, update immediately.

## The Long-Term Solution

The OpenClain RCE vulnerability highlights a fundamental issue with local LLMs:

**When you download AI responses from the internet, you're executing code on your machine.**

### Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never run AI tools on your main machine**
   - Use a dedicated VPS
   - Or use Docker with network isolation

2. **Keep everything updated**
   - OpenClaw releases security patches frequently
   - Subscribe to their security advisory feed

3. **Monitor your logs**
   - Check for unusual activity
   - Review OpenClaw logs regularly

4. **Use a VPN**
   - If running on a VPS, restrict access via VPN
   - Don't expose OpenClaw to the open internet

## FAQ

### Is DeepSeek R1 affected?

No. The vulnerability is in **OpenClaw**, not the AI models. However, malicious AI responses can **trigger** the vulnerability in OpenClaw.

### I'm using Ollama directly, am I safe?

If you're using Ollama without OpenClaw, you're **not affected by this specific vulnerability**. However, always keep Ollama updated.

### Can I just disable OpenClaw's network access?

Yes, that's a good interim fix. But the vulnerability can still be triggered through local file operations. Update to v0.4.2+ instead.

## Summary

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Update OpenClaw | ✅ Fixes vulnerability |
| Run in Docker | ✅ Contains the damage |
| Use a VPS | ✅ Safest option |

**Bottom Line:** If you're running OpenClaw on your main computer, you're putting your system at risk. Either update immediately, or move to a VPS.

### Still Stuck? Check Your Hardware

Sometimes the code is fine, but the GPU is simply refusing to cooperate. Before you waste another hour debugging, compare your specs against the **[Hardware Reality Table](/guides/hardware-requirements-reality-check)** to see if you are fighting impossible physics.
