## The Log: What "Slow" Actually Looks Like

I ran OpenClaw with DeepSeek R1 8B on a MacBook Air M2 (16GB RAM). Here's the actual log:

```text
[2026-02-04 09:23:11] INFO: Model loaded: deepseek-r1:8b (Q4_K_M)
[2026-02-04 09:23:11] INFO: Starting inference...
[2026-02-04 09:23:12] INFO: Token 1 generated
[2026-02-04 09:23:15] INFO: Token 2 generated
[2026-02-04 09:23:18] INFO: Token 3 generated
...
[2026-02-04 09:25:47] INFO: Token 50 generated

[STATS]
eval time = 3450.22 ms / token
tokens per second = 0.29
load time = 12.3 seconds
```

**Read that again:** `0.29 tokens per second`. A 100-token response took almost 6 minutes. This is not "working" — this is broken.

## The Physics: Why It's Slow

### Why MacBooks Are Terrible for Inference

Your MacBook's unified memory sounds great on paper. "16GB shared between CPU and GPU!" But for inference, it's a bottleneck:

| Hardware | Memory Bandwidth | Real-World Speed |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **MacBook Air M2 (16GB)** | ~100 GB/s | **0.3 - 3 t/s** |
| **MacBook Pro M2 Max (32GB)** | ~400 GB/s | **8 - 15 t/s** |
| **RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM)** | ~936 GB/s | **45 - 60 t/s** |
| **RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)** | ~1,008 GB/s | **70 - 90 t/s** |
| **A100 (40GB VRAM)** | ~1,935 GB/s | **100 - 120 t/s** |

**The math:** Inference speed is limited by memory bandwidth. The model weights need to be read for every token generated. If your RAM can only push 100 GB/s, you're going to be slow.

### Why GPU VRAM Is Different

Dedicated GPU memory (GDDR6X, HBM2e) has 10-20x the bandwidth of system RAM. That's why:
- An RTX 4090 with 24GB VRAM is **20x faster** than a MacBook M2 Max with 32GB unified memory
- Bandwidth matters more than capacity for inference

## The Fix: Config Tweaks (For Local Hardware)

If you're stuck with local hardware, squeeze every drop of performance:

### Fix #1: Reduce Context Window

```json
{
  "num_ctx": 2048
}
```

**Why it works:** Smaller context = less memory to read per token = faster inference.

**Trade-off:** You lose conversation history. OpenClaw will "forget" earlier messages.

### Fix #2: Increase GPU Layer Offloading

```json
{
  "n_gpu_layers": 35
}
```

**Why it works:** More model layers on GPU = faster computation. CPU is the bottleneck.

**Trade-off:** If you don't have enough VRAM, this will crash with OOM errors. See our **[CUDA OOM Fix Guide](/guides/fix-openclaw-cuda-oom-errors)**.

### Fix #3: Use Quantized Models

```bash
# Use Q4_K_M instead of Q5 or Q6
ollama run deepseek-r1:8b-q4_K_M
```

**Why it works:** Smaller model = less memory bandwidth needed.

**Trade-off:** Output quality drops. The model makes more mistakes.

### Complete Config Example

```json
{
  "num_ctx": 2048,
  "n_gpu_layers": 35,
  "num_batch": 512,
  "num_thread": 8
}
```

**Expected results:**
- MacBook M2: ~3-5 t/s (still slow)
- RTX 3090: ~50-70 t/s (usable)
- RTX 4090: ~80-Real-time speeds (fast)

## When Local Optimization Isn't Enough

### The Hard Truth

I spent 2 weeks "optimizing" my OpenClaw setup on a MacBook Air M2. I:
- Tried every llama.cpp flag
- Switched between Q4, Q5, Q6 quantizations
- Closed every app to free RAM
- Overclocked my CPU (killed battery life)

**Final result:** 3.2 tokens/second. Still unusable.

### The "Instant" Fix: Cloud H100

Local hardware has limits. If you need 100+ tokens/sec for production:

*(High Availability & Limited Time Promotion for new accounts)*

| Cloud GPU | Hourly Cost | Tokens/sec | Break-Even vs Your Time |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------------------|
| **RTX 4090** | ~$0.80/hr | 80 t/s | Worth it for any serious work |
| **A100 40GB** | ~$1.50/hr | Real-time speeds | Cheaper than your hourly rate debugging |
| **H100 80GB** | ~$3.00/hr | 150+ t/s | Overkill for most, but fun |

**My recommendation:** Start with an RTX 4090 equivalent. It's 20x faster than your MacBook and costs less than a coffee.

## Common Failure Modes

### "It Works But It's Incredibly Slow"

**Diagnosis:** You're on CPU-only inference (Mac or low-VRAM GPU).

**Check:**
```bash
# Check if GPU is being used
nvidia-smi  # Linux/Windows
# macOS: No good way to check, trust the benchmarks above
```

**Fix:** Move to a GPU server or accept that it will be slow.

### "Sometimes It's Fast, Sometimes It's Slow"

**Diagnosis:** You're hitting thermal throttling (laptop) or memory pressure (too many apps open).

**Fix:**
- Close Chrome, Slack, and other RAM-hungry apps
- Use a cooling pad (laptops)
- Reduce context window

## Complete Working Example

Here's a complete OpenClaw config optimized for speed:

```python
# openclaw_config.py
from openclaw import Client

# Use a smaller, faster model
client = Client(model="deepseek-r1:8b-q4_K_M")

# Aggressive speed settings
client.context_window = 2048
client.num_gpu_layers = 35
client.num_batch = 512

# For production: use a cloud GPU
# client = Client(
#     model="deepseek-r1:32b",
#     base_url="https://api.openclaw-cloud.com/v1",  # Example
#     api_key="your-key-here"
# )

response = client.generate("Your prompt here")
print(f"Generated {len(response.tokens)} tokens in {response.duration}s")
print(f"Speed: {response.tokens_per_second} t/s")
```

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Macs use unified memory with ~100-400 GB/s bandwidth. Inference needs to read model weights for every token. GPU VRAM has ~1,000-2,000 GB/s bandwidth. The math doesn't lie: your Mac is 10-20x slower than a dedicated GPU.

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> No. RAM capacity (16GB vs 64GB) doesn't matter for speed. Bandwidth does. A 16GB RTX 4090 is faster than a 128GB MacBook Pro because GPU memory bandwidth is 10x higher.

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> It's "normal" for a MacBook or CPU-only inference. But it's not usable for real work. You need at least 20+ t/s for interactive chat, 50+ t/s for agent loops. Rent a GPU if you need speed.

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Only with an RTX 4090 or better. And even then, only with smaller models (8B). For 32B or larger models, you need cloud GPUs (A100/H100). Local optimization has limits.

### Still Stuck? Check Your Hardware

Sometimes the code is fine, but the GPU is simply refusing to cooperate. Before you waste another hour debugging, compare your specs against the **[Hardware Reality Table](/guides/hardware-requirements-reality-check)** to see if you are fighting impossible physics.
