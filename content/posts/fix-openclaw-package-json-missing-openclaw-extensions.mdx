> **TL;DR: The Instant Fix**
>
> **The Problem:** Installing an OpenClaw plugin fails with `package.json missing openclaw.extensions`. The plugin package is outdated and doesn't include the required metadata.

> **The Solution:**
> 1. **Quick Fix:** Use the unified `@openclaw-extensions/channels` package instead
> 2. **Real Fix:** Contact plugin maintainer to add `openclaw.extensions` metadata

## The Log: What You're Seeing

**The Error:**

```bash
[INFO] Installing plugin: @openclaw-extensions/my-plugin
[ERROR] Plugin validation failed
Error: package.json is missing openclaw.extensions field

Package validation failed for: @openclaw-extensions/my-plugin
Expected format:
{
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": {
      "type": "provider",
      "entry": "./dist/index.js"
    }
  }
}

[Agent] Unable to load plugin
[CLI] Installation aborted
```

**Context:** This error occurs when installing OpenClaw plugins that were created before the unified extensions schema was standardized. The plugin package exists but lacks the required `openclaw.extensions` metadata in its `package.json`.

**Observed Behavior:**
- Plugin download succeeds
- Validation immediately fails
- OpenClaw refuses to load the plugin
- No workaround in the UI

---

## Why This Happens (It's a Metadata Schema Mismatch)

This is a **Plugin Metadata Schema Issue**.

OpenClaw's plugin system assumes:
- **All plugins include** `openclaw.extensions` metadata
- **Metadata format matches** the current schema
- **Plugin maintainers update** packages when schema changes

But you're installing:
- **An outdated plugin** created before schema standardization
- **A third-party package** that doesn't follow OpenClaw conventions
- **A deprecated plugin** that hasn't been updated

### The Schema Evolution Problem

| Era | Plugin Format | Metadata Required | Status |
|-----|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Early OpenClaw** | Ad-hoc, unstandardized | Optional or none | ❌ Deprecated |
| **Transitional** | Mixed formats | Varied by plugin | ⚠️ May break |
| **Current** | Unified schema | `openclaw.extensions` required | ✅ Standard |

**The error means:** The plugin you're trying to install was created before OpenClaw standardized the `openclaw.extensions` metadata field. Current versions of OpenClaw require this field for all plugins.

## Solution A: Use Unified Extensions Package (Recommended)

The easiest fix is to use the official `@openclaw-extensions/channels` package, which includes all common integrations with proper metadata.

### Step 1: Uninstall the Broken Plugin

```bash
# Remove the problematic plugin
openclaw plugin remove @openclaw-extensions/my-plugin

# Or manually delete from node_modules
rm -rf node_modules/@openclaw-extensions/my-plugin
```

### Step 2: Install the Unified Package

```bash
# Install the official extensions package
npm install -g @openclaw-extensions/channels

# Or using OpenClaw CLI
openclaw plugin install @openclaw-extensions/channels
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check installed plugins
openclaw plugin list

# Should show:
# @openclaw-extensions/channels (installed)
```

**Why This Works:** The unified package is maintained by the OpenClaw team and includes all standard integrations (Slack, Discord, Teams, etc.) with correct metadata.

---

## Solution B: Manually Add Metadata (For Custom Plugins)

If you're developing your own plugin or need to use a specific third-party plugin, you can manually add the required metadata.

### Step 1: Locate the Plugin's package.json

```bash
# Find the plugin directory
cd node_modules/@openclaw-extensions/my-plugin

# Or if globally installed
cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/@openclaw-extensions/my-plugin
```

### Step 2: Edit package.json

Add the `openclaw.extensions` field:

```json
{
  "name": "@openclaw-extensions/my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "openclaw": {
    "extensions": {
      "type": "provider",
      "entry": "./dist/index.js",
      "schema": "1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Reload OpenClaw

```bash
# Restart OpenClaw to pick up changes
openclaw restart

# Or if running as service
systemctl restart openclaw
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This is a temporary fix. If you update the plugin, your changes will be overwritten. Contact the plugin maintainer to add the metadata permanently.

---

## Solution C: Pin OpenClaw Version (Last Resort)

If you must use an outdated plugin, you can downgrade OpenClaw to a version that didn't require `openclaw.extensions` metadata.

### Step 1: Check Plugin Requirements

```bash
# Check the plugin's documentation
# Look for "Compatible with OpenClaw version X.Y.Z"
```

### Step 2: Downgrade OpenClaw

```bash
# Uninstall current version
npm uninstall -g openclaw

# Install specific version
npm install -g openclaw@<compatible-version>

# Example:
# npm install -g openclaw@0.5.12
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Downgrading exposes you to security vulnerabilities and bugs that were fixed in newer versions. Only do this if absolutely necessary.

## The "Survival" Recommendation

> **Stop debugging plugin metadata mismatches.**
>
> Every hour you spend editing package.json files, hunting for compatible versions, or manually adding metadata is an hour you're not shipping.
>
> **Plugin ecosystems break locally. A clean cloud environment + pinned versions reduces surprise breakage.**

### Local Development vs Cloud VPS Comparison

| Issue | Local Development | Cloud VPS (Vultr) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Plugin compatibility** | Mixed versions, breaks often | Fresh install, all current |
| **Metadata schema** | Outdated plugins cause errors | Everything standardized |
| **Debug time** | 2-4 hours (version hunting) | 0 minutes (works immediately) |
| **Updates** | Manual, breaks things | Controlled, tested |
| **Cost** | "Free" (but your time = billable hours) | Hourly billing options |

## Complete Working Example

### Verified Plugin Installation

```bash
# 1. Remove broken plugin (if installed)
openclaw plugin remove @openclaw-extensions/my-plugin

# 2. Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# 3. Install unified extensions package
npm install -g @openclaw-extensions/channels

# 4. Verify installation
openclaw plugin list

# Output:
# Installed plugins:
# - @openclaw-extensions/channels (v2.1.0)
#   - slack: Enabled
#   - discord: Enabled
#   - teams: Enabled

# 5. Test plugin functionality
openclaw test --plugin slack

# Success: Plugin loaded and functional
```

### Docker Alternative (Bypasses Plugin Issues)

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install OpenClaw
RUN npm install -g openclaw

# Install unified extensions
RUN npm install -g @openclaw-extensions/channels

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

CMD ["openclaw"]
```

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t openclaw-with-plugins .
docker run -it --rm openclaw-with-plugins

# Plugins work immediately in fresh container
```

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> OpenClaw updated its plugin schema to require <code>openclaw.extensions</code> metadata. Plugins created before this change don't have the required field. You either need to use a newer version of the plugin or manually add the metadata.

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, and you should. Open an issue on the plugin's GitHub repository or contact the maintainer. The fix is simple — they just need to add the <code>openclaw.extensions</code> field to their package.json.

      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Use the unified <code>@openclaw-extensions/channels</code> package instead. It includes all common integrations and is actively maintained. If you need custom functionality, consider forking the plugin and adding the metadata yourself.

    <h3 itemProp="name">Q: Will manually editing package.json survive updates?</h3>
    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> No. When you update the plugin (<code>npm update</code>), your changes will be overwritten. This is a temporary workaround. The permanent fix is for the plugin maintainer to add the metadata.

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Usually not. Downgrading exposes you to security vulnerabilities and bugs that were fixed in newer versions. Use the unified extensions package or find an alternative plugin that's actively maintained.

      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Pin your OpenClaw and plugin versions in package.json. Use <code>"openclaw": "1.2.3"</code> instead of <code>"openclaw": "latest"</code>. Test updates in a staging environment before deploying to production. Deploy on a VPS where you can snapshot and rollback easily.
