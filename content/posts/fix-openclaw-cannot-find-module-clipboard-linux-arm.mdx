## The Log: What You're Seeing

**The Error:**

```bash
[INFO] Starting OpenClaw...
[ERROR] Error: Cannot find module '@mariozechner/clipboard-linux-arm-gnueabihf'
Require stack:
- /app/dist/index.js:15:23
- at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)

[System] Clipboard module failed to load
[Agent] Unable to use clipboard functionality
```

**Context:** This error occurs on Linux ARM devices (Raspberry Pi, ARM servers, etc.) when OpenClaw tries to load the clipboard package. The package has prebuilt binaries for x86/x64 but not for ARM.

**Observed Behavior:** OpenClaw starts but crashes or loses clipboard functionality. Copy/paste operations may fail silently.

---

## Why This Happens (It's an Architecture Mismatch)

This is a **Prebuilt Binary Availability Issue**.

OpenClaw uses the `@mariozechner/clipboard` package for clipboard operations. This package includes:
- **Prebuilt native binaries** for x86/x64 (Intel/AMD)
- **Fallback pure-JS implementation** for other architectures

On Linux ARM (aarch64), if the npm version is old (< 9.0.0), it may:
- Try to load a non-existent ARM binary
- Fail to fall back to the pure-JS implementation
- Crash with "Cannot find module" error

### The ARM Architecture Problem

| Architecture | Prebuilt Binary | Pure-JS Fallback | Status |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| **x86/x64** (Intel/AMD) | ✅ Included | ✅ Available | Works out of box |
| **ARM64** (Raspberry Pi, ARM servers) | ❌ Not included | ⚠️ May not load | Needs npm v9+ |
| **ARMv7** (Raspberry Pi Zero/older) | ❌ Not included | ❌ Not compatible | Needs manual build |

## Solution A: Upgrade OpenClaw (Recommended)

The clipboard dependency was made optional in newer versions of OpenClaw. Upgrading is the cleanest fix.

### Step 1: Check Current Version

```bash
# Check current OpenClaw version
openclaw --version

# Or if installed via npm
npm list -g openclaw
```

### Step 2: Upgrade OpenClaw

```bash
# Uninstall old version
npm uninstall -g openclaw

# Install latest version
npm install -g openclaw@latest

# Or using npx (always runs latest)
npx openclaw@latest start
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check version again
openclaw --version

# Start OpenClaw
openclaw start

# Should work without clipboard errors
```

**Why This Works:** Newer versions of OpenClaw made the clipboard dependency optional. If it can't load, OpenClaw continues without clipboard functionality instead of crashing.

---

## Solution B: Use Docker (Bypass Native Dependencies)

If upgrading doesn't work or you need immediate results, Docker bypasses all native module issues.

### Step 1: Create Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install OpenClaw
RUN npm install -g openclaw

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Everything works in Linux container
CMD ["openclaw"]
```

### Step 2: Build and Run

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t openclaw-arm .

# Run container
docker run -it --rm openclaw-arm
```

**Why This Works:** Docker creates an isolated environment where OpenClaw runs without ARM-specific native dependencies.

## The "Survival" Recommendation

> **Stop debugging ARM compatibility issues.**
>
> Every hour you spend rebuilding modules, searching for ARM-compatible packages, or debugging architecture mismatches is an hour you're not shipping.
>
> **Debugging ARM compatibility is a huge time sink. x86 VPS just works.**

### Local ARM vs Cloud VPS Comparison

| Issue | Local ARM (Raspberry Pi, etc.) | Cloud VPS (x86) |
|-------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Prebuilt binaries** | Often missing | Always included |
| **Clipboard module** | May need manual build | Works immediately |
| **Debug time** | 2-4 hours (build, test, fail) | 0 minutes |
| **Performance** | Limited CPU/RAM | Scalable |
| **Cost** | Hardware upfront + time | Hourly billing options |

## Complete Working Example

### Verified Linux ARM Configuration

```bash
# 1. Check architecture
uname -m
# Output: aarch64 (ARM64)

# 2. Check current OpenClaw version
openclaw --version
# Or: npm list -g openclaw

# 3. Uninstall old version
npm uninstall -g openclaw

# 4. Install latest version
npm install -g openclaw@latest

# 5. Verify it works
openclaw start
# Should start without clipboard errors
```

### Docker Alternative (Instant Fix)

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install OpenClaw
RUN npm install -g openclaw

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

CMD ["openclaw"]
```

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t openclaw-arm .
docker run -it --rm openclaw-arm
```

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> The clipboard package only includes prebuilt binaries for x86/x86_64. On ARM (aarch64), the package tries to load an ARM binary that doesn't exist. Newer OpenClaw versions made this dependency optional to fix this issue.

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Usually not. OpenClaw maintains backward compatibility for config files. Your <code>openclaw.json</code> should work with newer versions. Backup your config before upgrading just in case.

    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema.org/Answer" itemProp="acceptedAnswer">
      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, and it's usually faster. x86 servers have better performance and more software compatibility. ARM is great for power efficiency, but for development work, x86 VPS saves debugging time.

      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> No. Any app using <code>@mariozechner/clipboard</code> on Linux ARM will have this issue. OpenClaw fixed it by making the dependency optional. Other apps may still have this problem.
