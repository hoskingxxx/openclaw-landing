## The Log: What You're Seeing

**The Error:**

```bash
[2026-02-04 10:23:45] INFO: Starting OpenClaw agent...
[2026-02-04 10:23:45] ERROR: Failed to start CLI
Error: spawn npm ENOENT
    at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (node:internal/child_process:283:19)
    at onErrorNT (node:internal/child_process:477:11)
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)

[Agent] Unable to execute tool: run_command
[System] CLI initialization failed
```

**Context:** This error occurs when OpenClaw tries to execute `npm` commands but can't find the `npm` executable.

**Observed Behavior:** OpenClaw starts loading, then immediately crashes when it tries to use any CLI-based tool.

---

## Why This Happens (It's Not a Bug)

This is an **Environment Configuration Mismatch**.

OpenClaw's CLI tools assume:
- **Node.js is installed** on your system
- **`npm` is accessible** via PATH
- **Permissions allow** executing subprocesses

But your setup has:
- **Node.js not installed** OR
- **Node not in PATH** OR
- **Wrong Node version** (< 18.x)

**The error `ENOENT` means "Error NO ENTry" — the system cannot find the file you asked it to execute.**

### Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| **Fresh OS install** | Node.js not installed |
| **Multiple Node versions** | Wrong Node version in PATH |
| **Docker container** | Node not installed in container |
| **Windows** | Node installed but PATH not updated |
| **macOS with Homebrew** | Homebrew binaries not in PATH |

---

## Solution A: Verify Node Installation

**Step 1: Check if Node is installed**

```bash
# Check Node version
node --version

# Check npm version
npm --version

# Check which npm is being used
which npm
```

**Expected Output:**
```
v18.x.x or higher
9.x.x or higher
/usr/local/bin/npm  (or similar)
```

**If you get `command not found`:** Node.js is not installed.

**Step 2: Install Node.js (if missing)**

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install node

# Ubuntu/Debian
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Windows
# Download from: https://nodejs.org/
```

**Step 3: Add Node to PATH (if installed but not found)**

```bash
# Find your Node installation
# Common locations:
# macOS Homebrew: /opt/homebrew/bin/
# Linux: /usr/local/bin/ or /usr/bin/
# Windows: C:\Program Files\nodejs\

# Add to PATH (macOS/Linux)
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

# Make it permanent (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## Solution B: The Docker Fix

If you're running OpenClaw in Docker, Node.js must be installed **inside the container**.

**Dockerfile example:**

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install OpenClaw
RUN npm install -g openclaw

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# This ensures npm is available
CMD ["openclaw"]
```

**Verify npm is in container:**

```bash
# Build and run
docker build -t openclaw-cli .
docker run -it openclaw-cli sh

# Inside container, verify:
which npm
# Should output: /usr/local/bin/npm
```

## Solution C: The VPS Fix (Recommended)

Why debug environment issues when you can have everything pre-configured?

### Local vs Cloud Comparison

| Issue | Local Setup | Cloud VPS (Vultr) |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Node.js** | Manual install required | Pre-installed |
| **npm in PATH** | Requires shell config | Already configured |
| **Version conflicts** | nvm needed | Isolated environment |
| **Setup Time** | 30-60 minutes | 60 seconds |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | You manage it | Host manages it |

### The ROI Calculation

**Local "Free" Setup:**
- Install Node.js: 10 minutes
- Debug PATH issues: 20 minutes
- Handle version conflicts: 30 minutes
- **Total time:** 60 minutes × $50/hr = **$50**

**Cloud Setup:**
- Create instance: 2 minutes
- Everything pre-installed
- **Total time:** 2 minutes = **$0**

## The "Survival" Recommendation

> **Stop debugging environment issues.**
>
> Every hour you spend fixing PATH, installing Node versions, or debugging Docker is an hour you're not shipping.
>
> **The smart choice:** Deploy on a VPS where everything just works.

## Complete Working Example

### Verified Configuration

```bash
# 1. Verify Node installation
node --version  # Should be v18+
npm --version   # Should be v9+

# 2. Verify npm in PATH
which npm       # Should show path to npm

# 3. Start OpenClaw
openclaw start

# Success: [INFO] CLI initialized successfully
```

### Docker Configuration

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  openclaw:
    image: node:18-alpine
    working_dir: /app
    command: npx openclaw start
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
```

      <p itemProp="text">
        <strong>A:</strong> Yes, but ensure nvm is loaded in your shell before starting OpenClaw. Add <code>source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh</code> to your shell config if needed.
