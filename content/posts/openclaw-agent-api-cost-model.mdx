OpenClaw feels "free" until you run agents in a loop—then the real bill is compute, not software.

# Why OpenClaw Agents Blow Up API Bills: The Loop Cost Model

> **TL;DR**
> - If you're debugging an agent, your cost scales with **loop count × context tokens × run count**.
> - Use the snippet below to estimate cost quickly, then compare against fixed-cost compute.
>
> ```bash
> # Example cost estimate (edit numbers to match your trace + provider pricing)
> node -e "const loops=5,ctx=10000,out=2000,inP=0.14,outP=0.28,runs=50,days=30;
> const inT=loops*ctx, outT=loops*out;
> const perTask=(inT/1e6)*inP+(outT/1e6)*outP;
> console.log('per task $'+perTask.toFixed(4));
> console.log('per month $'+(perTask*runs*days).toFixed(2));"
> ```

## The Log: what you're seeing

A common pattern: a simple prompt causes repeated "think → tool → think" loops, and the agent keeps re-reading growing context.

## Why this happens (Resource Mismatch)

Agents are loop-based. Each loop reads context (input tokens) and emits output tokens. Even if each loop is "small," total usage accumulates quickly.

## The physics (the math)

### Assumptions (examples)

These are **illustrative** numbers to demonstrate the model. Replace them with your real trace and your provider's published prices.

- Loops per task: **5**
- Context tokens read per loop: **10,000**
- Output tokens per loop: **2,000**
- API pricing (example): input **$0.14/1M**, output **$0.28/1M**
- Debug runs per day: **50**
- Days per month: **30**
- Cloud GPU hourly (example): **$2.5/hour**

### Tokens per task

- Input tokens per task: **50,000**
- Output tokens per task: **10,000**

### Cost per task (example)

Using the example assumptions above:

- Cost per task (example): **$0.01**
- Cost per month (example): **$14.70**

## The Fix: measure your trace, then decide

1) Capture one real agent trace:
- average context tokens read per loop
- average output tokens per loop
- number of loops per task
- tasks per day during debugging

2) Plug those numbers into the model and compute monthly spend.

3) Compare to fixed-cost compute.

## Breakpoint table (API vs Cloud GPU)

| GPU hours/day | GPU monthly cost (assumption) | API monthly cost (assumption) | Cheaper |
|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| 0.5 | 37.50 | 14.70 | API |
| 1 | 75.00 | 14.70 | API |
| 2 | 150.00 | 14.70 | API |
| 3 | 225.00 | 14.70 | API |
| 4 | 300.00 | 14.70 | API |
| 6 | 450.00 | 14.70 | API |
| 8 | 600.00 | 14.70 | API |

## The "Survival" recommendation (correct architecture)

Local debugging is bounded by your time and your machine. Fixed-cost compute is bounded by runtime, not tokens.

If your measured monthly API spend exceeds your expected GPU monthly runtime spend, move agent debugging to a clean, isolated Linux environment.

### Still Stuck? Check Your Hardware

Sometimes the code is fine, but the GPU is simply refusing to cooperate. Before you waste another hour debugging, compare your specs against the **[Hardware Reality Table](/guides/hardware-requirements-reality-check)** to see if you are fighting impossible physics.
