# OpenClaw Unofficial Site Scope (MVP)

## 🚨 CORE IDENTITY
This site is an **Unofficial Survival Guide** for developers trying to run OpenClaw with DeepSeek R1 locally.
It is NOT a SaaS product. It is NOT a marketing landing page.

## ✅ IN SCOPE (Keep & Maintain)
1. **Homepage:**
   - "Survivor" style hero section (OOM logs).
   - Links to the Guide and Hardware Reality check.
   - "No-Phishing" promise.
2. **Blog / Guides:**
   - The "DeepSeek R1 Battle-Tested Guide" (The core asset).
   - Future guides about OOM errors or Configs.
3. **Resources:**
   - VPS / Hardware recommendations (The monetization layer).
   - Official Links (GitHub / Discord) for credibility.
4. **FAQ:**
   - Only technical Q&A (e.g., "Why does it crash?").
   - Remove marketing Q&A (e.g., "What is an AI Employee?").

## ❌ OUT OF SCOPE (Delete Immediately)
Any feature that makes us look like a "Wrapper" or "Fake Official Site" must go:
1. **Video Tutorials:** We are not a media company. (Delete `app/videos`).
2. **Command Generator:** We are not a SaaS tool. (Delete `app/command-builder`).
3. **Use Cases:** We are not selling solutions. (Delete `app/use-cases`).
4. **Marketing Copy:** Terms like "AI Employee", "Revolutionary", "One-click magic".

## 🔗 NAVIGATION RULES
- **Navbar:** Home, Docs (Quick Start), Guides (Blog).
- **Footer:** About (Unofficial disclaimer), External Links, Affiliate Disclosure.
